## Welcome

Welcome to the **DiaDNAAPI documentation**.

Here you'll find all the information you need to authenticate, connect, and interact with our API endpoints.

### Getting Your Secret Key

To access the DiaDNAAPI, you must include a `secret-key` in your request headers.  
This key is essential for validating and securing your API requests.

> üí¨ **How to get your `secret-key`**:  
> Please reach out to one of our support team members. They will provide you with your personal `secret-key`.

Once you have your key, use it in the headers of every request as shown below:

```http
GET /your-endpoint
Host: https://prod.di-dna.mobioffice.io/
secret-key: your-secret-key
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Ensure your `secret-key` is kept confidential. Invalid or missing keys will result in authentication errors.
